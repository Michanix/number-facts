## Number facts!
This small application was created with React as a part of the Web programming course.

This simple app uses [Number Facts](http://numbersapi.com/) API to fetch JSON data with different facts about numbers 
and present to user.

### Installation and Usage
If you would like to try it then follow next steps:

```
git clone git@github.com:Michanix/number-facts.git
cd /number-facts
npm install 
npm start
```

This app will start on port **3000**, so make sure nothing is running there.
And finally navigate to [localhost](http://localhost:3000/) and get some facts!
